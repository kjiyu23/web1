<h2>스포트라이트</h2>
<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spotlight_2015" target="_blank" title="로튼토마토">Spotlight</a> gracefully handles the lurid details of its <strong>fact-based <u>story</u></strong> while resisting the temptation to lionize its heroes, resulting in a drama that honors the audience as well as its real-life subjects.
<p style="margin-top:45px;">SPOTLIGHT tells the riveting true story of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigation that would rock the city and cause a crisis in one of the world's oldest and most trusted institutions. When the newspaper's tenacious "Spotlight" team of reporters delves into allegations of abuse in the Catholic Church, their year-long investigation uncovers a decades-long cover-up at the highest levels of Boston's religious, legal, and government establishment, touching off a wave of revelations around the world. Directed by Academy Award-nominee Tom McCarthy, SPOTLIGHT is a tense investigative dramatic-thriller, tracing the steps to one of the biggest cover-ups in modern times.</p>
